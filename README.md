VEML7700 Lux Meter for Flipper Zero
This is an application for the Flipper Zero that measures ambient light intensity using a VEML7700 sensor and displays the result in lux (lx).

Features
Real-time Reading: The application continuously refreshes and displays the measured light intensity value.

Configurable Gain: The user can easily adjust the sensor's gain, which allows for measurements in various lighting conditions, from very dim to very bright. Available options are: 1/8, 1/4, 1, and 2.

I2C Address Change: The I2C address of the VEML7700 sensor can be configured.

Simple Menu: Intuitive navigation using the Flipper Zero buttons (OK, arrows, Back).

Hardware Requirements
Flipper Zero device.

VEML7700 ambient light sensor connected to the GPIO pins.

Usage
Make sure the VEML7700 sensor is correctly connected to the Flipper Zero (I2C pins).

Launch the application. By default, it will show the light intensity value.

To go to the settings, press the OK button. In the settings menu, you can change the gain (Wzmocnienie) and the I2C address (Adres I2C).

Use the left and right buttons to change the values in the settings.

After changing the settings, the application will automatically re-initialize the sensor with the new configuration.

To return to the main screen, press OK or Back.

Press the Back button on the main screen to exit the application.
